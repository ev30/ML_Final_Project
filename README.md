02-620 Machine Learning Final Project: Using Machine Learning to Analyze COVID-19 Case Numbers

Machine Learning has played a substantial role in solving complex healthcare problems. With the application of different machine learning algorithms, we built different models to make predictions on COVID-19 cases using publicly available data. This would be beneficial to communities and organizations in response to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Here we implemented four different methods - K-means clustering, Poisson Regression, Random Forest  and Support Vector Regression (SVR) - to develop our models. Of these models, the SVR model indicates the most accurate prediction. 

All code is in jupyter notebook format and the cells can be run as they are to generate the results.

ML_Project_Clustering_Final_V2.ipynb contains the code for k-means clustering.

time_series.ipynb contains the code for LinearSVR and Random Forest regression.

poisson V2.ipynb contains the code for Poisson regression.
